title: Bead ga-e0t1 - Repair pre-kickoff inspection and trusted workflow bootstrap Continuation
---

## Session: 2026-09-10 00:14 CEST
**AI Assistant**: Codex
**Developer**: loucmane
**Bead**: `ga-e0t1`
**Work**: Continue bead ga-e0t1 using the existing bead-scoped plan and active work tracking for Repair pre-kickoff inspection and trusted workflow bootstrap.
**Work Source**: Continuation session for bead ga-e0t1

### Session Validation
- [x] Date confirmed (`date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z %z'` -> `2026-09-10 00:14:04 CEST +0200`)
- [x] Git branch checked (`codex/ga-e0t1-orchestrator-bootstrap`)
- [x] Bead identity recorded (`ga-e0t1`)
- [x] Reused bead active work tracking (`docs/ai/work-tracking/active/20260903-ga-e0t1-orchestrator-bootstrap-ACTIVE/TRACKER.md`)
- [x] Reused bead plan (`plans/2026-09-03-ga-e0t1-orchestrator-bootstrap.md`)

### Session Goals
- [x] Start a fresh daily session for existing bead `ga-e0t1` work.
- [x] Reuse the existing `ga-e0t1` active work tracking instead of allocating shadow work.
- [x] Repoint `sessions/current` and `plans/current` to the continuation state.
- [ ] Continue implementation and verification with S:W:H:E evidence.

### Starting Context
Bead `ga-e0t1` continuation was created via `python3 scripts/codex-task sessions continue --bead ga-e0t1`, preserving the existing bead-scoped plan and active work tracking without Taskmaster mutation.

Preflight passed 64 tests; recovery first run preserved one replay failure and its correction. Expanded tests, full regression, independent review and signed delivery remain pending. Core journals/worktrees, R12 consumed failure, R13 HOLD and all live platform state remain unchanged.

Reuse R3, full02 and independently completed API conditions; prepare signed source delivery with original dirty files/journals preserved. No live reconciliation or platform/worker action.
