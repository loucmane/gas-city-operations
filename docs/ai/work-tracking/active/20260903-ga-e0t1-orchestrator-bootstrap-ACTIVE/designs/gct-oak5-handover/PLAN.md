# gct-oak5 handover: C1 (Claude) → X (Template codex) → C2 (Claude) in one worktree — plan r2

This is the design for goal step 4 (gct-oak5; gct-13ku and gct-10pg are its closed prerequisites). It is reviewed before any window package is built. Every window, tool and Bead text named here is its own reviewed package later. r2 answers the r1 reviews of `8b7bb3ae` (A and B HOLD); see the last section.

## Decisions this plan relies on

- **2026-09-24, handover admission (a).** One Template Bead scope, without Core's one-start attempt stamp. One worker at a time is proven as follows:
  - **Within a lane:** by the claim and `max_active_sessions = 1`.
  - **Across the two agents:** by the window gates only, namely the suspension overlay and the session and cgroup census. The per-agent cap cannot exclude a concurrent Claude and codex session, so the gates are the cross-agent proof.
- **2026-09-27, "New codex choice".** The Template codex agent gets `classified-vault-and-template-candidate-worktrees`. Its write roots are the vault and the whole candidate root, with no `.git`. A2, M12 and P13 are live.
- **2026-09-27, "Adapt acceptance".**
  - The handover images cover HEAD, unstaged and untracked work, and Bead evidence.
  - Staged work is recorded as not provable, because neither lane can write `.git`.
  - After C2, the coordinator's reviewed intake signs, then the PR, CI and merge follow.
  - No provider-parity claim is made beyond this evidence.
- **Live state.**
  - The Claude lane is `gas-city-template/gc.implementation-worker`:
    - provider `claude-template-candidate`;
    - policy Edit on `candidate-root/*/**`, `.git` denied, unsandboxed `bd close|show|update`;
    - `work_dir_roots` the candidate root, cap 1;
    - receipt profile `2341a9a0`.
  - The codex lane is `gas-city-template/codex`, cap 1, with `work_dir_roots` both Template roots. Its live default choice is still `classified-vault-template-worktrees-and-git-metadata`.
  - M12 file `114b4a00`, P13 receipt `7185414e`, revision `a61666b3`.

## Beads

**Root.** `gct-oak5` stays the root and carries the acceptance. It is never routed.

**Steps.** Three step Beads, `C1`, `X` and `C2`, are created in `gas-city-template` with label `handover`.
- **Edges:**
  - each step `relates-to` the root, never parent-child, because bd 1.2.2 hides children of an open parent from `bd ready`;
  - C1 `blocks` X and X `blocks` C2, so a later step is neither ready nor claimable while its predecessor is open.
- **Holders.** Each step description is short and points to closed holder Beads, per the split pattern: every plain view stays under about 9,000 bytes.

**Image holders.** Each image is written as a new closed holder Bead after its window's TERMINAL: `H1` (image 1) and `H2` (image 2). The following window's PREP pins the holder's description digest, and BIND pins the step's description. The X and C2 step descriptions name their image holder by id, and the split package creates that id in advance as an empty placeholder. The image holder is written only after the previous TERMINAL.

**Stop contract.** Each step's acceptance is its stop point:
- the worker records its evidence note;
- it closes only its own step Bead;
- it never touches `gct-oak5`, another step or a holder.

This rests on the brief, and each CLOSE verifies it (see Windows).

**Step contracts** (declared paths are fixed in the split package):

| Step | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| C1 | Implement the first half of a small bounded Template change: a documented helper module plus its test file. It must end with exactly the declared set: one modified tracked file `M1` and one new untracked file `A1`. It runs no tests and creates no cache files. |
| X | First verify the worktree against H1's per-path digests; on mismatch, note `IMAGE MISMATCH` and stop. Do not redo C1's edits. Add exactly one modified tracked file `M2` and one new untracked file `A2`; run no tests and create no caches. Then record the note. Only after that, run the negative probes. Then close X. |
| C2 | Verify H2 the same way. Finish the change in `M1`, `M2`, `A1` and `A2` only. Run the Template test command sandboxed, with `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` and pytest `-p no:cacheprovider`, and record the result. Run the negative probe. Close C2. |

**The X brief overrides the codex prompt explicitly** on three points:
- "stage and verify the reviewed tree": X does not stage;
- "a permission refusal is a stop": the listed probes are expected refusals and do not stop the segment;
- close only X.

**Negative probes** run after the edits and the note. Each expected refusal is pinned exactly, and each probe's outcome is recorded on the step:
- **X, `git -C <worktree> commit --allow-empty -m probe`.** Expected: the refusal to create the index or `HEAD` lock in the canonical `.git/worktrees/gct-oak5/` with EROFS or EACCES. "Nothing to commit" does not count as a refusal.
- **X and C2, a write outside every write root of the lane.** The target is `/home/loucmane/.local/share/gas-city-staging/gct-oak5-handover/probe-target/<step>`, an empty operator directory. It is outside:
  - the vault;
  - both Template roots;
  - `/tmp`, TMPDIR and the cwd;
  - the Claude policy's Edit grant.

  Expected: X is refused by the sandbox; C2 is refused by the policy or the sandbox. The window checks that the target directory stays empty.

No step stages, commits, pushes, signs or touches git state.

## The worktree

One linked worktree of the canonical Template: `/home/loucmane/gas-city-template-candidate-worktrees/gct-oak5` on `codex/gct-oak5-handover-proof`, at BASE `3474abfa` (Template origin/main, the M11/M12 pinned commit).

**Created by** a reviewed WORKTREE job. It is the gct-mbg6 `worktree-task-r1` retargeted to the candidate root, with the pre-add driver, attributes and gitlink checks. The candidate root must hold exactly this worktree during the handover.

**Canonical `HEAD` stays at `3474abfa`.** Adding the worktree changes the metadata-pinned Template `.git` tree:
- dispatch is not refused, because `InspectIntegrity` does not examine metadata trees;
- **M13**, the next metadata successor, must admit that change as an exact pair.

**Lifecycle.**
- The worktree is kept, unchanged, from C1 until the intake has signed and the PR has merged.
- A reviewed retire job then archives and locks it (the ga-x7lx pattern) or removes it.
- M13 runs after that and before any other metadata successor or Template window. It admits the Template `.git` pair left by WORKTREE and retire.

## Handover images and the route gate

**The tool** is `intake_template.py export`, generalised in a reviewed package:
- **Output location.** The candidate root and the probe-target parent join `FORBIDDEN_ROOTS`. The GitHub-only bare BASE clone, every image, every scratch mirror and every export live under `~/.local/share/gas-city-staging/gct-oak5-handover/`, outside every lane write root. `outside()` checks the clone and every scratch path, not only the output directory.
- **Nested `.git`.** Any path component named `.git`, case-insensitively, below the top level refuses.
- **Ignored entries.** They are no longer summarised as a path list. Each is recorded with its type, mode, size and sha256, and links, hard links and special files among them refuse.
- **Limits.** Empty directories and group or other mode bits are not recorded. This is stated as a limit of the byte-exact claim.
- **Runtime entries.** `RUNTIME` is decided per lane by a read-only inventory before the tool's review:
  - what gc writes into a worktree at a Claude session start and at a codex session start, and whether it overwrites, merges or skips an existing file;
  - each admitted runtime entry is pinned with its exact expected bytes per lane.

**Image *n*** is the export manifest (every changed, added, deleted and ignored path against BASE, with mode, blob id, sha256 and size) plus the following, read as files and not with git:
- the worktree `.git` gitfile bytes;
- the admin `HEAD`, `gitdir` and `commondir`;
- the branch ref;
- the canonical `HEAD`;
- the full state of `gct-oak5` and of all three steps and the holders: status, assignee, description digest, notes digest and every metadata key;
- the chained common-snapshot digest (see Windows).

**The route gate** is ROUTE's pre-check for X and for C2, done by the coordinator. It refuses unless all of the following hold:
1. **Unchanged since the image.** The recomputed image is byte-equal to the image holder's recorded image.
2. **The delta is exactly the contract.**
   - Image 1 minus BASE is exactly {`M1` modified, `A1` added}.
   - Image 2 minus image 1 is exactly {`M2` modified, `A2` added}, with `M1` and `A1` unchanged.
   - There are no deletions and no other paths.
3. **No agent-control path is present or changed,** other than admitted runtime entries equal to their pinned bytes. Refused paths:
   - anything under `.codex/`, `.agents/` or `.claude/`;
   - any file named `AGENTS*.md`, `CLAUDE*.md`, `.mcp.json`, `conftest.py`, `sitecustomize.py` or `*.pth`;
   - the stop names.

   `.codex/hooks.json` must be absent in image 1, because no codex session has run there.
4. **No ignored entries at all** in images 1 and 2. C1 and X run no tests and create no caches.
5. **Bead state is as expected.** `gct-oak5` and the non-current steps are unchanged, and the previous step is closed by its own worker.

**Exactly once.** The final acceptance repeats rules 1 to 3 on the final export: `M1`, `A1`, `M2` and `A2` are each present once with the C2 content, and no step note is duplicated.

**Tamper negative, with a positive control.** On a copy outside every write root:
- the unchanged copy must verify, after normalising the manifest's `worktree` field;
- the same copy with one byte of `A1` changed must refuse.

A tool test also covers a changed ignored file, a planted `.codex/hooks.json` and a nested `.git`.

## Windows

Each segment is one reviewed window. Each is a successor package generated with asserted replacements from the last window that ran on the same lane, and rebased onto M12 and P13:

| Window | Derived from | Routes | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C1 | ga-3oa7 (last Claude candidate-lane window), retargeted to the Template rig and Claude lane as the gct-e8ex window retargeted ga-3oa7 to Template codex | step `C1` | |
| C2 | C1's package, rebased | step `C2` | adds the image-2 route gate |
| X | the gct-e8ex window s3 (last Template codex window) | step `X` | adds the image-1 route gate |

**X's PREP overlay** narrows the composed codex schema to `worklog_access` ∈ {`classified-vault`, `classified-vault-and-template-candidate-worktrees`}. It selects the latter and binds `work_dir` to the handover worktree. A composed-schema assertion checks this, as in `test_successor.py` of the gct-e8ex window.

**Every window:**
- **BIND** stamps `gc.work_dir` (the handover worktree). For C1 and C2 it also stamps `gc.check_path`, the Template launch check pinned in P12/P13 (the pack `build-artifact-valid.sh`). A missing stamp refuses; Core's start preflight requires it.
- **Common snapshot.** It uses the gct-e8ex `common-snapshot-r1.py` (the full Template `.git` walk, not ga-3oa7's narrower one), chained: each window's `before` must equal the previous window's `after`.
  - One admitted change: the linked worktree's admin `index` may be rewritten by a session's own startup git (for example Claude Code's git context). It is admitted only if its parsed entries (path, mode, blob id, flags) are unchanged and only stat data moved.
  - A read-only check before C1 inventories whether this happens.
- **CLOSE:**
  - runs `verify_linked` on the worktree;
  - audits the candidate root, which must hold only `gct-oak5`;
  - checks that the probe target stays empty;
  - verifies `gct-oak5`, the non-current steps and the holders are unchanged;
  - re-runs the audit that no default-choice codex route targets the candidate root (from A2).
- **Cache disposition.** It needs the operator's approval per window.

**Same-lane concurrency negative** (replaces r1's cross-agent probe). During C1's WATCH, with the C1 session live, a guarded `gc sling <probe-bead> gas-city-template/gc.implementation-worker --no-formula --no-convoy --json` routes a throwaway, edgeless probe Bead. It carries no `gc.work_dir`, a `probe` label and a description that says do nothing.
- **What it proves:** the Claude lane's `max_active_sessions = 1` holds under a second routed item. The census shows exactly one session and no second worker cgroup through the rest of WATCH.
- **Cleanup:** CLOSE restores the probe Bead's full pre-sling snapshot, meaning status, assignee and every `gc.*` key, and closes it. The full snapshot is taken before the sling. The probe never touches a step Bead.
- Cross-agent exclusion rests on the gates, as stated above.

## After C2: intake, signing and delivery

The gct-mbg6 intake runs unchanged in method:
1. export from the handover worktree, with no git there, and rules 1 to 5 on the final state;
2. the reviewed tree id in a scratch index outside every write root;
3. the exported bytes committed to the Operations worktree for two aegis-reviewer passes;
4. signing in a standalone Template clone from GitHub at BASE;
5. the tree id must equal the reviewed one;
6. then the signed commit, push, Template PR, required-green CI, merge, and close of the steps and `gct-oak5`.

**The canonical checkout is not moved by delivery.** It stays at `3474abfa` until a later reviewed metadata successor moves it.

## Acceptance as adapted (recorded on gct-oak5)

- **One registered worktree.** C1, X and C2 ran in one registered worktree on one branch, under one root Bead with three step Beads.
- **One worker and claim at a time.**
  - Within a lane: the claim and the cap, with the same-lane negative.
  - Across agents: the suspension gates and the census.
  - Zero session and process residue after each window.
- **Images and single deltas.**
  - Images 1 and 2 are byte-exact at each switch: HEAD, unstaged, untracked and ignored content, the gitfile and admin files, Bead state and the chained common snapshot.
  - Each segment's delta is exactly its contract, and each is present exactly once at the end.
  - Staged work is not provable under the no-`.git`-write lanes, as the operator decided on 2026-09-27.
  - Empty directories and group or other mode bits are outside the image.
- **Negatives refused:**
  - writes outside each lane's write roots (X and C2);
  - a codex `git commit`, with the pinned lock refusal;
  - a second session on a capped lane (same-lane);
  - an image mismatch on a tampered copy, with a positive control.

  Containment inside the candidate root rests on the top-level-entry audit, not on the sandbox.
- **Delivery.** Coordinator intake signature, signed PR, required-green CI and merge.
- **No provider-parity claim** beyond this evidence.

## Order of packages

1. This plan, then two reviews.
2. **Read-only inventories:**
   - the gc runtime files per lane;
   - Claude and codex startup git in a scratch linked worktree of a throwaway clone, never the canonical Template;
   - the Template test command offline.
3. The split package (steps, holders, image-holder placeholders, `blocks` and `relates-to` edges), then two reviews, then applied.
4. The image tool, then two reviews.
5. WORKTREE, as part of C1.
6. The C1 window, then two reviews, then run.
7. H1.
8. The X window, then two reviews, then run.
9. H2.
10. The C2 window, then two reviews, then run.
11. The intake, signing and delivery.
12. The retire job, then M13.
13. Terminal evidence on gct-oak5.

Codex quota for X is re-checked immediately before X's ROUTE. If it is short, that is the standing stop condition.

## r2 (answers the r1 reviews of `8b7bb3ae`: A and B HOLD)

- **Must_fix: planted control files (A 2, B 1).** The route gate now checks the delta's shape and refuses agent-control paths. Runtime entries are admitted only with pinned bytes per lane, `.codex/hooks.json` must be absent before X, and ignored entries must be empty (Handover images and the route gate).
- **Must_fix: out-of-worktree negatives (A 1, B 3).**
  - Each probe target sits outside every lane write root.
  - The acceptance says "outside the lane's write roots".
  - Containment inside the candidate root rests on the per-window top-level audit.
- **Must_fix: second-route negative (B 2, A should_fix 3).**
  - The cross-agent sling is dropped.
  - A same-lane probe uses an exact sling form and a full-snapshot restore.
  - The proofs are restated consistently.
- **Should_fix taken:**
  - the `gc.check_path` stamp is fixed in BIND (A 1, B 6);
  - image holders with description re-pins (A 2);
  - the full chained common snapshot with the admin-index rule (A 4, B 4);
  - `verify_linked` and the top-level audit after every window (A 5);
  - CLOSE verifies Bead state (A 6, B 3);
  - codex prompt overrides and pinned probe errors (A 7, B 5);
  - a positive control for the tamper test (A 8);
  - ignored content hashed (A 9, B 1);
  - BASE clone and outputs outside every root (A 10);
  - `blocks` edges (A 11);
  - worktree lifecycle and M13 (A 12);
  - schema wording (A 13);
  - nested `.git` (B 2);
  - cross-agent proof stated (B 7);
  - the image limits stated (B 8).
